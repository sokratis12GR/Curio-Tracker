# Curio Tracker

This tool allows you to quickly take a screenshot of the grand heist curio displays and save them as rewards data so that you can quickly analyze the kind of loot you found during your runs.

F5 - Captures the current layout (i.e layout: Prohibited Library, ilvl: 83), should always start with this when entering the Grand Heist as it will make every reward saved bound to that layout and ilvl.

F2 - Screen capture the entire screen, it will take a screenshot of the current screen, read the text on it and save the data in a .csv output, it reads duplicates (in the last 60 seconds) and doesn't save them in the file.

F4 - Provides you with a small snippet tool in case you like to manually take a screenshot of the item name/enchant and allows for duplicate values so if a wing had 2 or more of the same reward this is recommended.

F3 - Well every tool needs a way to exit it, so this is all it does, closes the tool.
